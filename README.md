# Music_Generation
The purpose of our project is music generation to user preference with AI to make a music list for user.

By using the interface we build, user can easily upload two music, one serves as a whiteboard the other serves as a preference indicator. We hope that we can generate a music as similar as the whiteboard music while keep the features of perference. 

Above message is our midterm purposal. However, we did not build the user interface at last. Since it will cost many time and is not required. :P

Also, in the presentation, this is a good result of our project. Yet, most of the time, our output are pretty strange. So, there may be something wrong about our code. I'll take a look at it again when I get time to upload.

Last, shout out to professor Rini~ Ciao Ciao~
